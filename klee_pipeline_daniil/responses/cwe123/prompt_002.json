YOUR TASK (STRICT)\nFor **every** `.c` file provided in the user message, you **MUST** generate **two** new C files:\n\n1.  **An Instrumented File (e.g., `instrumented_source.c`)**:\n    * This is a copy of the original C file.\n    * Remove all I/O functions (e.g., `printf`, `fgets`).\n    * Replace all input sources with calls to an external symbolic source function (e.g., `extern int __klee_source();`).\n    * **DO NOT** include `<klee/klee.h>` in this file.\n\n2.  **A Driver File (e.g., `driver_source.c`)**:\n    * **You MUST include `<klee/klee.h>`.**\n    * This file defines the `main()` function.\n    * It defines the `__klee_source()` function(s) using `klee_make_symbolic`.\n    * It calls the instrumented function from the other file (e.g., `CWE123_..._bad();`).\n\nYou will also generate **one `build.sh`** and **one `run_klee.sh`** script that compile and run **all** drivers.\n\n### 2. BUILD & KLEE INSTRUCTIONS (STRICT)\n1.  **CWD Assumption**: All scripts MUST assume they are run from *inside* their parent directory (`./cwes/cwexxx/output/generated/`). All C files are in the same directory.\n2.  **`build.sh`**: **Must** begin with `set -e`. Must use `clang -emit-llvm` to compile **all** drivers and instrumented files into separate `.bc` files (e.g., `clang -emit-llvm -c driver_source.c -o driver_source.bc`).\n3.  **`run_klee.sh`**: **Must** begin with `set -e`. Must run KLEE on **each** driver's `.bc` file.\n4.  **KLEE Flags**: Use the flags: `--posix-runtime -libc=uclibc`.\n5.  **KLEE Output**: After *each* KLEE run, rename `klee-last` (e.g., `mv klee-last driver_source_klee`).\n\n### 3. OUTPUT FORMAT (ABSOLUTELY STRICT)\n1.  **DO NOT** respond with *any* text, explanations, or titles.\n2.  Your *entire* response MUST only be file paths and content, separated by `\u2736`.\n3.  **File Paths**: All generated files **MUST** be placed in the directory `./cwes/cwexxx/output/generated/`, where `cwexxx` is the lowercase CWE number (e.g., `cwe124`).\n\n--- START OF CODE ---\n/home/daniil/ersp/ersp-harness-generation/daniil/automated/cwes/cwe123/examples/example/driver.c\n// driver.c\n#include \"klee/klee.h\"\n\n// Provide the symbolic source used by the instrumented bad function\nint __klee_source(void) {\n    int data;\n    klee_make_symbolic(&data, sizeof(data), \"data\");\n    // Optional bounds to speed up search; remove if you want unbounded\n    klee_assume(data >= -100 && data <= 100);\n    return data;\n}\n\n// Declaration of the instrumented Juliet bad function (same name)\nvoid CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad(void);\n\nint main(void) {\n    CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n/home/daniil/ersp/ersp-harness-generation/daniil/automated/cwes/cwe123/examples/example/driver_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c\n// driver_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c\n#include \"klee/klee.h\"\n\n/* Provide the symbolic source used by the instrumented bad function */\nint __klee_source(void) {\n    int data;\n    klee_make_symbolic(&data, sizeof(data), \"data\");\n    return data;\n}\n\n/* Pull in the instrumented implementation (same directory or adjust the path) */\n#include \"instrumented_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c\"\n\n/* Exact Juliet function name is preserved in the included file */\nint main(void) {\n    CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad();\n    return 0;\n}\n\n\n/home/daniil/ersp/ersp-harness-generation/daniil/automated/cwes/cwe123/examples/example/instrumented_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c\n// instrumented_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c\n#include <stddef.h>\n\nint __klee_source(void);  // defined by the driver\n\nvoid CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad(void) {\n    int data = __klee_source();     // model the socket-provided int\n\n    int i;\n    int buffer[10] = {0};\n\n    // Bad sink: checks only lower bound; missing upper bound check\n    if (data >= 0) {\n        buffer[data] = 1;           // KLEE will flag OOB when data >= 10\n        for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n            (void)buffer[i];        // keep side effects\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\n\n/home/daniil/ersp/ersp-harness-generation/daniil/automated/cwes/cwe123/examples/example/README.md\n# KLEE Harness\nWe divide harness generation into two parts:\n- Driver: makes inputs symbolic and calls the target entrypoint.\n- Instrumented file: preserves the exact vulnerable function but replaces real I/O with a stubbed source; focuses only on the sink (hotspot) logic. \n\nIn this example:\n- The driver defines __klee_source() via klee_make_symbolic, then #includes the instrumented file and calls the original function name (our symbolic-execution entrypoint).\n- The instrumented file targets just the sink logic, stubbing out non-interesting parts so exploration is small and fast.\n\n\n## Build and run\n### Compile just the driver (it includes the instrumented file)\nclang -emit-llvm -c -g -O0 \\\n      driver_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c \\\n      -o harness.bc\n\n### Run KLEE\nklee harness.bc\n\n\n## Example KLEE output\n\nKLEE: ERROR: ./instrumented_CWE121_Stack_Based_Buffer_Overflow__CWE129_connect_socket_01_bad.c:14: memory error: out of bound pointer\nKLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location\n\nKLEE: done: total instructions = 657\nKLEE: done: completed paths = 2\nKLEE: done: partially completed paths = 1\nKLEE: done: generated tests = 3\n\nThis means: KLEE found a concrete input that drives the program to an out-of-bounds write at the sink line in the instrumented file.

If you need to build on top of it to correct\n   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at\n   the tip of the \"master\".  This is not strictly necessary, but\n   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.\n\n * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic\n   branches, merge them into \"next\" branch.\n\nThe script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name\nto be \"next\", but it is trivial to make it configurable via\n$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.\n\nWith this workflow, you would want to know:\n\n(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to \"next\".  Young\n    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather\n    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been\n    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without\n    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would\n    not want to rewind it.\n\n(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to \"master\".\n    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not\n    build on top of it -- other people may already want to\n    change things related to the topic as patches against your\n    \"master\", so if you need further changes, it is better to\n    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the\n    tip of \"master\".\n\nLet's look at this example:\n\n\t\t   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"next\"\n\t\t  /       /           /           /\n\t\t /   a---a---b A     /           /\n\t\t/   /               /           /\n\t       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /\n\t      /   /   /             \\         /\n\t     /   /   /   b---b C     \\       /\n\t    /   /   /   /             \\     /\n    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o \"master\"\n\n\nA, B and C are topic branches.\n\n * A has one fix since it was merged up to \"next\".\n\n * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to \"master\" and \"next\",\n   and is ready to be deleted.\n\n * C has not merged to \"next\" at all.\n\nWe would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage\nB to be deleted.\n\nTo compute (1):\n\n\tgit rev-list ^master ^topic next\n\tgit rev-list ^master        next\n\n\tif these match, topic has not merged in next at all.\n\nTo compute (2):\n\n\tgit rev-list master..topic\n\n\tif this is empty, it is fully merged to \"master\".\n\nDOC_END\n\n\n/home/daniil/ersp/ersp-harness-generation/daniil/automated/cwes/cwe123/examples/example/.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.sample\n#!/bin/sh\n#\n# An example hook script to prepare the commit log message.\n# Called by \"git commit\" with the name of the file that has the\n# commit message, followed by the description of the commit\n# message's source.
